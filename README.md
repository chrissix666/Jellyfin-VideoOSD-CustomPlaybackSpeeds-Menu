# Jellyfin VideoOSD Custom Playback Speeds

!!BEFORE USE, CONFIG THE SPEEDS IN THE .js ON TOP FIRST!!

Tested on & Requirements: Windows 11, Chrome, Jellyfin Web (10.10.7), JavaScript Injector.

Default/Vanilla ones are 11 speeds: 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4

Customizes the Jellyfin Web VideoOSD playback speed menu.  
You can define your own speed list, add custom values, remove unwanted vanilla/default entries, and keep the menu sorted.

Example speeds in the script & screenshot: 0.1, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 10

Playback speed range: `0.0625x` - `16x`  
Behavior depends on the Chrome/Chromium video engine, not on Jellyfin.

Note: During testing, values below `0.1x` could cause problems when switching back to very high speeds afterwards. Playback also became very choppy and pitchy, although audio still continued to work.<br>
For practical use, the recommended minimum speed is around `0.2x` to `0.25x`.
